In #UnrealEngine 5, experimental DeformerGraphEditor (Optimus) plugin allows using custom skeletal skinning & deformation HLSL algos. I quickly tested it with simple scaling & randomization. It is built on top of interesting ComputeFramework.

This repository contains simple third person template based example with working deformer graph. Created and tested on ue5-main https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/commit/b5751dda93007a2ae29b8949460046429998ada9.
